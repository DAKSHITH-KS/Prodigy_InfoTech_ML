PRODIGY INTERNSHIP - MACHINE LEARNING

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prodigy Infotech for providing me with the opportunity to work on these projects and for their invaluable support and guidance throughout my internship journey. Here is an overview of my approach to the tasks assigned to me.

TASK 1: House Price Prediction

This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is trained on a dataset containing housing information and aims to provide accurate price estimates based on these factors.

TASK 2: Customer Segmentation

The goal of this project is to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Using K-means clustering, customers are grouped according to their purchase frequency and total spending. The dataset contains synthetic customer purchase data, detailing how often they make purchases and their total expenditure. By applying K-means clustering, distinct customer segments are identified, allowing the retail store to personalize marketing strategies and product recommendations for different customer groups. The project includes data generation, clustering implementation, and visualization of the results.

TASK 3: Cat vs Dog Classification

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to differentiate between images of cats and dogs using the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) Cats vs Dogs dataset. The images are preprocessed, resized, and normalized before being used to train the SVM model. After training, the model is evaluated on a subset of the dataset to assess its accuracy. Finally, a sample image is tested to demonstrate the modelâ€™s classification capability. This project serves as a fundamental example of applying machine learning (SVM) for image classification tasks.

TASK 4: Hand Gesture Recognition

This project focuses on building a hand gesture recognition model to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from images or video frames. The aim is to enhance human-computer interaction through gesture-based control systems. The model is trained on a dataset containing various hand gestures, such as thumbs up, peace sign, and pointing. Advanced deep learning techniques (CNNs) are used to extract meaningful features from gesture images, enabling the model to recognize and classify new hand gestures with high accuracy. This technology can be applied in interactive systems, sign language recognition, and virtual reality applications.

TASK 5: Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation

This project aims to develop a model capable of recognizing food items from images and estimating their calorie content. The objective is to assist users in tracking their dietary intake and making informed food choices. The model is trained on a diverse dataset containing images of various food items along with their corresponding calorie values. Using deep learning techniques (CNNs), the model learns to identify different foods and estimate their calorie content accurately. Once trained, the model can analyze food images and provide users with estimated calorie values, helping them monitor their nutrition and maintain a healthy diet.
